#### Biography
I'm 22 and in my last year (hopefully) at Eastern Washington University getting a degree in Computer Science with a major in Management Information Systems.  I'm hoping to go into front-end web development in the future if possible.  I really like animals and have a tiny zoo going on in my room as I've a snake, two geckos, a lizard, and a bird.
